# What does it do?

Arithmetic operations on currency amounts. Amounts on input and output are arbitrary large and
precise:

    99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999.99
    +
    0.01
    =
    100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.00

However, in cases when the division is involved — like for percentage calculation — the result is
rounded to the whole cent: 33% of $0.50 is $0.17 instead of $0.165

As a bonus feature, there's a simple formatting function for amounts in CHF, EUR, USD, GBP, and JPY.

# Why does it exist?

Because storing currency amounts in floats [is a really bad idea](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730019/why-not-use-double-or-float-to-represent-currency)

# How to use it?

## Installation

Install via [Composer package manager](http://packagist.org):


Just create a `composer.json` file for your project:

    {
        "require": {
            "ikr/money-math": "0.1.*"
        }
    }

And run these two commands to install the Composer dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar install

Now you can add the Composer's autoloader, and you will have access to the `MoneyMath\*` classes:

    <?php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

## API

    use MoneyMath\Decimal2;
    use MoneyMath\Currency;

    $a = new Decimal2("3.50");
    $b = new Decimal2("4.50");

    $a->integerValue()                          // 3
    $a->fractionValue()                         // 50
    $a->centsValue()                            // 350

    strval(Decimal2::plus($a, $b))              // "8.00"
    strval(Decimal2::sum([$a, $a, $b]))         // "11.50"
    strval(Decimal2::avg([$a, $b]))             // "4.00"
    strval(Decimal2::minus($a, $b))             // "-1.00"
    strval(Decimal2::staticMultiply($a, 2))           // "7.00"
    strval(Decimal2::mul($a, $b))               // "15.75"

    strval(Decimal2::div($a, $b))               // "0.78"
    strval(Decimal2::getPercentsOf($a, $b))     // "0.16" b% of a
    strval(Decimal2::cmp($a, $b))               // -1

And last, but not least :)

    $c = new Decimal2("42.02");
    strval(Decimal2::roundUpTo5Cents($c))       // "42.05"

Which we use for bills in CHF that are required by law to be 0 (mod 5).

For formatting please use the `Currency` class

    (new Currency('EUR'))->format(new Decimal2('-100000000000.00')) // -100.000.000.000,00
